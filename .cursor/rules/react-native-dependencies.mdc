You MUST:
- Use React Native 0.73.x with pinned, stable versions. NEVER use "latest", "^", or "~".
- Prefer Yarn. Do not add Expo unless explicitly requested later.
- If a dependency conflicts, DOWNGRADE to the last stable compatible set rather than upgrading core RN.
- Generate small, focused commits with clear messages. Include README updates when setup changes.
- Write TypeScript with strict mode, ESLint + Prettier, and basic Jest tests.
- For data in MVP, use local mock JSON + typed repositories (no remote calls). Later we will switch to a real backend.
